# ijeep
 - real time marker (immediately reflect the user marker to the driver map)
 - individual marker for each user (replace the last marker with the new marker (pinaka complicated nga function))
 - firebase google and facebook login (need localhost or htttp)
 - login and sign in error trappings
 - added new html file specific for drivers and commuters.

# TODO
 - Webpage link should be standardized eg. commuter/login.html, commuter/map.html (commuter can only see map.html), driver/login.html, driver/map.html, admin/...(if ever included) etc.
 - Data visualization
 - Page for drivers to see users who have put a marker, and maybe add a button that redirects them to the user mark in the map. (tbd)
 - etc
